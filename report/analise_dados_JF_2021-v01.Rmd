## Variables

### Primary and secondary outcomes

### Covariates

## Statistical analyses

### Statistical packages

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.
Packages used for survival analyses were `survival` version `r packageVersion("survival")` and `survminer` version `r packageVersion("survminer")`.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

## Time to prosthesis failure
```{r}
# summary(sf.1, times = 1:2)
# philsfmisc::format.pct(1-c(0.885,0.821,0.955), 0)
# philsfmisc::format.pct(1-c(0.793,0.712,0.883), 0)
```

Times to prosthesis failure ranged from 7 weeks to almost 3 years.
The total failure rate at the end of study follow up was 23% so the median time of failure could not be estimated.
After one year under observation the rate of failure was 12% (4% -- 18%), while after two years the estimated failure rate is 21% (12% -- 29%).
