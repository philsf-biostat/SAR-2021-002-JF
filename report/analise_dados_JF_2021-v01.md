## Variables

### Primary and secondary outcomes

### Covariates

## Statistical analyses

### Statistical packages

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version 4.0.5.
Packages used for survival analyses were `survival` version 3.2.10 and `survminer` version 0.4.9.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

## Time to prosthesis failure


Times to prosthesis failure ranged from 7 weeks to almost 3 years.
The total failure rate at the end of study follow up was 23% so the median time of failure could not be estimated.
After one year under observation the rate of failure was 12% (4% -- 18%), while after two years the estimated failure rate is 21% (12% -- 29%).
There were no significant differences among groups when comparing genders, smoking status or the knee side operated on (Table 2).
